Not sure where to put this, but here is my ~/poky/build/conf/bblayers.conf

--- bblayers.conf ---

# LAYER_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
LCONF_VERSION = "4"

BBFILES ?= ""
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /home/scott/poky/meta \
  /home/scott/poky/meta-yocto \
  /home/scott/poky/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
  /home/scott/poky/meta-sakoman \
  /home/scott/poky/meta-jumpnow \
  "

--- end bblayers.conf ---


And here are my diffs to the default ~/poky/build/conf/local.conf


--- local.conf diffs ---

+PREFERRED_PROVIDER_jpeg = "libjpeg-turbo"
+PREFERRED_PROVIDER_jpeg-native = "libjpeg-turbo-native"

-MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
+MACHINE ?= "overo"


+#SDKMACHINE ?= "i686"
+SDKMACHINE ?= "x86_64"

--- end local.conf diffs ---

I think only the MACHINE definition is needed.

The jpeg providers are just to quiet warnings.

The SDKMACHINE just seemed logical. I don't know what it does.

The PACKAGE_CLASSES was changed just messing around. I haven't tried to
load any packages manually.
