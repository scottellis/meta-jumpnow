Some notes can be found here [http://www.jumpnowtek.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85]

Important note: The MLO/u-boot combination built from meta-sakoman does not work
with either of my 512M RAM COMs. The systems will fail under load. 256M COMs are 
okay. 

To get around this, I am substituting an MLO/u-boot combination built with OE-classic. 

The u-boot and MLO I am using can be found here 

http://www.jumpnowtek.com/Downloads/bootloader-for-Yocto-builds/

Copy the MLO-overo and u-boot-over.bin found there to a $OETMP/deploy/images/classicboot
directory if you want to use the meta-jumpnow/scripts/copy_boot.sh script.

With this change, the images built here are stable and can build and run Syntro a
somewhat large Qt library and set of executables.
